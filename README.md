This project is based around recreating the Google homepage. Learning about positioning, alignment and styling. Also reinforcing knowledge around git commands, setting up a repo onto Github.

First commit was the started index.html with a linked external css file. Only the Google image and the search form is all that shows currently.

Second commit was spending the majority of time understanding layouts with flex. Links added for the navbar at top and then getting the Google logo and search box into positions.
