This project is based around recreating the Google homepage. Learning about positioning, alignment and styling. Also reinforcing knowledge around git commands, setting up a repo onto Github.

Started index.html with a linked external css file. Only the Google image and the search form is all that shows currently.

Spending the majority of time understanding layouts with flex. Links added for the navbar at top and then getting the Google logo and search box into positions.

More time spent with understanding layouts. Spent alot of time trying different types with the nav links such as inline-blocks. This allowed me to resize certain elements like the apps link with the background image.

After several more hours and several commits later, starting to get somewhat of a feel for layouts. Last commit on 12/16, I added more divs for better layout control instead of manually positioning elements. Feels cleaner and less hard coded. Progress!

Final commit (for now) shows finished product as far as the look. Need to look into making more responsive when the page is being resized.
